/*

The global Infinity property is a numeric value representing infinity.

Infinity is a property of the global object, or in other words, a variable in global scope.
The initial value of Infinity is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY.
The value Infinity (positive infinity) is greater than any other number.
Mathematically, this value behaves the same as infinity;
for example, any positive number multiplied by Infinity equals Infinity, and any number divided by Infinity equals 0.
As defined by the ECMAScript 5 specification, Infinity is read-only (implemented in JavaScript 1.8.5 / Firefox 4).

const maxNumber = Math.pow(10, 1000); // max positive number

if (maxNumber === Infinity) {
  console.log("Let's call it Infinity!");
  // expected output: "Let's call it Infinity!"
}

console.log(1 / maxNumber);
// expected output: 0

console.log(Infinity); /* Infinity */
console.log(Infinity + 1); /* Infinity */
console.log(Math.pow(10, 1000)); /* Infinity */
console.log(Math.log(0)); /* -Infinity */
console.log(1 / Infinity); /* 0 */
